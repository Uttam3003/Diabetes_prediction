# Diabetes_prediction
This project involves predicting diabetes using a dataset collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The data comes from a specific population, namely Pima Indian women aged 21 and older. The goal is to use various machine learning models to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on several health-related features.

## Project Steps:
# Introduction:

### The dataset contains health information about Pima Indian women, including variables such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI (Body Mass Index), and more.
### The project will explore the data, clean it, and apply various machine learning models to predict the presence of diabetes.

## Importing Required Libraries:

### Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and various machine learning tools from sklearn and xgboost are imported to handle data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

## Reading and Understanding the Data:

### The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
### The data contains 768 entries and 9 features, which include health-related variables and the target variable (Outcome), indicating whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### Exploring and Dealing with Zeros: The dataset contains some zero values in columns where they shouldn't logically exist, such as glucose or blood pressure. These zeros are likely incorrect or missing values, and the project deals with them by removing or replacing them.
### Distribution of Features: The project examines the distribution of various features to understand their behavior and relationships. For instance, glucose and blood pressure follow a normal distribution, while other features like age and pregnancies are skewed.
### Exploring Correlations: A heatmap is used to visualize correlations between features. For example, higher glucose levels are strongly associated with diabetes, while other relationships like BMI and skin thickness or age and pregnancies are also explored.
### Exploring Outliers: Outliers are identified in the data using statistical methods and visualized using boxplots. The project plans to handle these outliers in the preprocessing step using robust scaling.
### Distribution of the Target Variable: The outcome variable (diabetes diagnosis) is moderately imbalanced, meaning there are more cases of non-diabetes than diabetes in the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing:

### Separating Features and Target: The features (input variables) are separated from the target variable (Outcome) to prepare for model training.
Modeling:

### Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and more, will be applied to the data to predict diabetes. The models will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best-performing model.

## Conclusion:

### The final step will involve comparing the performance of the different models to identify the most accurate and reliable one for predicting diabetes in the given dataset. The conclusions will be based on the evaluation metrics mentioned above.
This project aims to develop robust machine-learning models that can accurately predict diabetes based on the provided dataset, leveraging a range of techniques from basic statistical analysis to advanced ensemble methods.
